Network Analysis of Kenyans On Twitter

We employ a methodology to find the top 50 Kenyans on twitter and identify their influences amongst each other. We then find the most centrally placed individual.
R programming language is employed in this analysis. Collected tweets are available in this repository.

Visualizing tweet tree structure was accomplished through [Treeverse](https://github.com/paulgb/Treeverse)
